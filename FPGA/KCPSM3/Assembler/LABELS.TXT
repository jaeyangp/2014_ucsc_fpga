The use of line labels can make programs much easier to read and develop.
Example.....
                    CALL delay50         ;call delay subroutine
                    .
                    .
                    .
           delay50: LOAD s3,32          ;Delay loop repeated 50 times
      inner_loop50: SUB s3,01
                    JUMP NZ, inner_loop50
                    RETURN
